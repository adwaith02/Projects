            <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of
                positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

                However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and
                moves along with page scrolling.

                Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.</p>
